Time: ~30–40 minutes (10 min prep + 20–30 min simmer)
Difficulty: Easy

Ingredients

400 g (14 oz) dried spaghetti

2 tbsp olive oil

1 medium onion, finely chopped

3 garlic cloves, minced

1 × 400 g (14 oz) can crushed tomatoes (or passata)

1 × 400 g (14 oz) can diced tomatoes (optional for texture)

1 tsp dried oregano (or 1 tbsp fresh chopped)

6–8 fresh basil leaves, torn (or 1 tsp dried basil)

1 tsp sugar (optional — cuts acidity)

Salt and black pepper to taste

Red pepper flakes (optional, pinch)

Freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino, to serve

Reserved pasta cooking water (see steps)

Optional meatball / meat options

400 g (14 oz) ground beef or pork (to brown into the sauce)

OR 12–16 small meatballs (pre-made or homemade)

Optional vegetarian boost

1 carrot, finely grated or diced

1 celery stalk, diced

1 tbsp tomato paste (for depth)

Method

Boil the pasta water: Fill a large pot with water, bring to a rolling boil. Salt generously (about 1–2 tbsp for a big pot). Add spaghetti and cook to 1–2 minutes before package al dente. Reserve 1 cup (240 ml) pasta water, then drain.

Start the sauce: While pasta cooks, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion (and carrot/celery if using) and sauté until soft, ~5–7 minutes.

Add garlic & tomato paste: Add garlic and, if using, 1 tbsp tomato paste. Cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant.

Tomatoes & seasoning: Add crushed tomatoes (and diced tomatoes if using). Stir in oregano, torn basil (reserve a little for garnish), sugar if desired, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if using.

Simmer: Bring to a low simmer and cook 10–20 minutes to let flavors meld. If sauce thickens too much, add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen.

If adding browned ground meat: brown the meat separately until just cooked, drain excess fat, then add to the sauce to simmer together.

If using pre-made meatballs, add them to the sauce to heat through for 10 minutes.

Finish: Taste and adjust salt/pepper. Toss drained spaghetti into the sauce (or ladle sauce over pasta) and toss for 30–60 seconds, adding reserved pasta water a little at a time to make the sauce glossy and help it cling.

Serve: Plate, top with grated cheese and extra basil. Enjoy.

Quick 15-minute version (when you’re short on time)

Use good-quality canned crushed tomatoes + 1 tbsp tomato paste, skip long simmer.

Sauté onion & garlic quickly, add tomatoes, heat, season well.

Cook pasta, toss with sauce, add pasta water to finish. Ready in ~15–20 minutes.

Aglio e Olio (garlic & oil — no tomatoes)

400 g spaghetti, 6 garlic cloves thinly sliced, 1/3 cup olive oil, pinch red pepper flakes, chopped parsley, salt.

Cook pasta, reserve water. Lightly brown garlic in oil (don’t burn), toss pasta in oil with pasta water, finish with parsley and cheese.

Tips & troubleshooting

Reserve pasta water — starchy water helps emulsify sauce so it clings.

Don’t over-salt the sauce early; taste after it simmers.

Acidity fix: a pinch of sugar or a knob of butter smooths an overly acidic sauce.

Make ahead: Sauce keeps 3–4 days in fridge or freezes 2–3 months. Reheat gently, add a splash of water.
