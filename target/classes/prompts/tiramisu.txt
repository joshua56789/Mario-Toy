Ingredients (classic)

3 large eggs, separated

100 g (½ cup) granulated sugar

500 g mascarpone (about 2 cups) — cold from fridge

1 cup (240 ml) strong espresso or very strong coffee, cooled

2–3 tbsp coffee liqueur (Kahlúa, Marsala, rum) — optional

200–250 g savoiardi / ladyfingers (about 24–30 pieces)

Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting

Dark chocolate shavings (optional)

Tip: use freshly brewed espresso if possible — it gives the best coffee flavor. Let it cool before using.

Method — Traditional (uses raw egg whites)

Make the coffee mix: Combine cooled espresso + coffee liqueur (if using) in a shallow bowl. Set aside.

Whisk yolks + sugar: In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy (~3–5 minutes by hand; 3–4 minutes with electric whisk). For extra safety you can gently cook this bowl over a simmer (double-boiler) to 70°C / 158°F while whisking for 3–4 minutes (this produces a light sabayon and reduces raw-egg risk). Let cool slightly.

Add mascarpone: Fold the mascarpone into the yolk mixture until smooth and lump-free. Do not overmix — you want a silky, slightly thick cream.

Whip egg whites: In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites to soft peaks, then to firm glossy peaks. Gently fold whipped whites into the mascarpone mixture in 2 additions — keep the mixture airy.

If you prefer a richer texture, fold in 150 ml (⅔ cup) softly whipped cream instead of (or in addition to) whipped whites.

Assemble: Quickly dip each ladyfinger 1–2 seconds on each side into the coffee mix (don’t soak — they should be moist but not soggy). Line the base of an 8×8 in / 20×20 cm dish or similar with a layer of soaked ladyfingers. Spread half the mascarpone cream evenly over the biscuits. Repeat with a second layer of soaked ladyfingers and remaining cream.

Chill: Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours; ideally 12–24 hours. This lets the flavors meld and the texture set.

Finish: Right before serving, dust generously with unsweetened cocoa powder and add chocolate shavings if you like.

No-raw-egg / Safer Version (quick)

Use this if you want to avoid raw eggs entirely.

Ingredients differences:

Skip eggs. Use 500 g mascarpone + 300 ml heavy cream + 75–100 g sugar (adjust sweetness).

Optional: 1 tsp vanilla extract.

Method differences:

Whip heavy cream with sugar (and vanilla) to soft–stiff peaks.

Fold whipped cream gently into mascarpone until smooth and airy.

Proceed with dipping ladyfingers and assembling as above.
This version is very stable, safer for kids/pregnancy, and still delicious though slightly lighter in taste.

Zabaglione (cooked egg) alternative — extra lux

If you want authentic flavor without raw whites: cook the egg yolks + sugar over a bain-marie (whisk to ribbon and about 70°C) into a zabaglione, cool, then fold into mascarpone. Fold in whipped cream for lift. This is essentially the safest “traditional” approach.

Timing plan (quick start)

Brew coffee & cool: 10 min (can be done earlier)

Make cream: 10–15 min

Assemble: 10 min

Chill: 4–24 hours (best after 24 h)

If short on time, chill a minimum of 2–4 hours — still tasty but less-set.

Storage

Keep refrigerated, covered. Best eaten within 48–72 hours.

You can freeze (assembled, well wrapped) up to 1 month; thaw overnight in fridge before serving (texture may change slightly).

Tips & troubleshooting

Don’t oversoak ladyfingers. 1–2 quick dips. Over-soaking → soggy, collapsed tiramisu.

Mascarpone temperature: Use cold mascarpone but let it soften slightly (10–15 min at room temp) so it blends smooth. Don’t let it go warm.

Texture: Fold gently to keep the cream light and airy. If the cream is too loose, chill it before assembling to firm slightly.

Coffee strength: Use strong espresso or concentrated coffee for pronounced coffee flavor. Add a splash more liqueur if you want boozier.

Cocoa last minute: Dust right before serving so it stays vibrant and not soggy.

Serving: Cut with a hot, clean knife for neater slices (dip knife in hot water, dry between cuts).
