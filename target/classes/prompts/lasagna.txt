Makes: one 9×13 inch (23×33 cm) pan — serves 6–8
Time: ~1 hr 30–120 min (active ~45–60 min + simmer/bake)

Ingredients

12 lasagna noodles (regular, or 9–12 no-boil sheets)

2 tbsp olive oil

1 large onion, finely chopped

2 carrots, finely diced

2 celery stalks, finely diced

3 garlic cloves, minced

500 g (1 lb) ground beef (or 50/50 beef/pork)

1 × 400 g (14 oz) can crushed tomatoes or passata

2 tbsp tomato paste

1 cup red wine (optional) or beef/chicken stock

1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried basil (or fresh if available)

Salt & pepper, pinch sugar (if tomatoes are acidic)

2 cups (about 200–250 g) shredded mozzarella

1 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino, divided

For the béchamel (white sauce)

4 tbsp (60 g) butter

4 tbsp (30–40 g) plain flour

3 cups (700 ml) milk, warmed

Pinch of nutmeg (optional), salt, white pepper

Method

Make the ragù: Heat oil in a large pan. Sauté onion, carrot, celery ~6–8 min until soft. Add garlic 30s. Increase heat, add ground meat, brown well; break lumps. Add tomato paste and cook 1 min. Pour wine (if using) and reduce ~2–3 min. Add crushed tomatoes, herbs, salt/pepper, pinch sugar. Simmer gently 20–30 min, uncovered, until thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Make the béchamel: Melt butter in saucepan over medium. Stir in flour and cook 1–2 min (do not brown). Gradually whisk in warm milk until smooth. Cook, stirring, until thickened to a pourable sauce coating the back of a spoon (5–8 min). Season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.

Boil noodles (if using standard dried): Cook to al dente, drain and lay flat on a sheet of baking paper or toss with a tiny oil to prevent sticking.

Assemble: Spread a thin layer of ragù on bottom of the pan (prevents sticking). Layer: noodles → ragù → béchamel → sprinkle mozzarella + a little Parmesan. Repeat 3 layers finishing with béchamel and remaining Parmesan (and mozzarella if you like it cheesy on top).

Bake: Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Cover foil and bake 25 min. Remove foil and bake 10–15 more minutes until bubbly and golden. Let rest 10–15 min before cutting (resting helps set the layers).

Tips

For a deeper flavor, make the ragù a day ahead — it improves overnight.

Use no-boil noodles? Skip pre-boiling; ensure sauce is a bit looser so noodles cook in oven.

Swap cheeses: fontina, provolone, or a mix work great.

To make ahead: assemble in pan, cover tightly, refrigerate up to 24 hours then bake (add 10–15 min to covered bake time). For freezing: freeze before baking or after cooling; see bottom.

Quick No-Boil Lasagna (Weeknight)

Makes: 9×13 pan — serves 6–8
Time: ~45–55 min

Ingredients (simple)

12 no-boil lasagna sheets

3 cups marinara or good-quality jarred tomato sauce

2 cups shredded mozzarella

1 1/2 cups ricotta mixed with 1 egg (optional) or cottage cheese

1/2 cup grated Parmesan

2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, salt & pepper

Method

Spread 1 cup sauce on bottom of pan.

Layer sheets (break to fit), dollops of ricotta mix, sauce, mozzarella; repeat 3 layers, finish with sauce + cheese.

Cover tightly with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) 40–45 min. Uncover last 5–10 min to brown. Rest 10 min.

Notes

No-boil saves time. If sauce is very thick, thin slightly with water or stock so noodles can hydrate while baking.

Vegetarian Lasagna (Spinach + Ricotta + Mushrooms)

Makes: 9×13 pan — serves 6–8
Time: ~1 hr

Ingredients

12 lasagna sheets (or no-boil)

2 tbsp olive oil

400 g mixed mushrooms, sliced

1 onion + 2 garlic cloves, chopped

400–500 g frozen spinach (thawed & squeezed dry) or 300 g fresh sautéed down

500 g ricotta (or 400 g ricotta + 1 cup shredded mozzarella inside)

1 egg (optional, binds ricotta)

3 cups marinara sauce

2 cups shredded mozzarella + 1/2 cup Parmesan

Salt, pepper, nutmeg

Method

Sauté onion + garlic, add mushrooms until golden. Mix with drained spinach. Combine spinach mixture with ricotta, egg (if using), salt/pepper & pinch nutmeg.

Assemble: sauce → noodles → ricotta-spinach → sauce → cheese. Repeat. Bake at 180°C (350°F) covered 30–35 min, uncover 10 min to brown. Rest 10 min.

Make-ahead & Freezing

Assemble & refrigerate: Assemble whole lasagna, cover tightly, refrigerate up to 24 hours. Bake from cold, add ~10–15 min to covered baking time.

Freeze unbaked: Assemble, wrap tightly (foil + plastic), freeze up to 3 months. Bake from frozen: keep covered; bake at 180°C (350°F) ~60–90 min (check internal temp ~70°C/160°F), uncover last 15 min.

Freeze baked: Cool fully, slice into portions, wrap and freeze. Reheat covered at 160–170°C (325–340°F) until warmed through, or microwave single portions.

Shopping checklist (basic classic)

Lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)

500 g ground beef (or mixed)

2 × 400 g canned tomatoes + tomato paste OR marinara sauce

Onion, carrot, celery, garlic

Milk, butter, plain flour (for béchamel)

Mozzarella, Parmesan (or Pecorino)

Olive oil, dried herbs, salt, pepper, sugar, nutmeg

Quick tips

Rest before slicing — 10–20 min gives clean slices.

Use a sharp serrated knife or heavy spatula for serving.

For lighter lasagna, replace half meat with finely diced roasted vegetables.

If béchamel is intimidating: substitute equal volume of ricotta thinned with milk for creamy layers.
