Time: 15–20 min
Oven: 200°C / 400°F

Ingredients

1 baguette or small loaf (about 250–300 g / 9–10 in)

115 g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened

3–4 garlic cloves, minced (about 1–1½ tbsp) — or 1½–2 tsp garlic paste

2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped (or 1 tsp dried parsley)

1/4 tsp fine salt, pinch black pepper

Optional: 2 tbsp grated Parmesan, pinch red pepper flakes, lemon zest

Method

Preheat oven to 200°C / 400°F.

Mix softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, salt, pepper (and Parmesan if using) until well combined.

Slice the baguette diagonally into 1–1.5 cm (½ inch) slices, keeping the base intact (if you prefer pull-apart) or slice all the way through for individual pieces.

Spread garlic butter generously between slices and over the top (or smear on individual slices). Wrap in foil (shiny side in) if you want soft insides; leave uncovered for crispier crust.

Bake 10–12 minutes (covered) then open foil and bake 2–3 more minutes to brown, or bake uncovered 10–12 min until golden. Serve hot.
