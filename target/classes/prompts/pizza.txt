Ingredients

500 g “00” or all-purpose flour

325 g water (65% hydration), cold or room temp

10 g fine salt

2 g instant dry yeast (≈½ tsp)

15 g olive oil (1 tbsp) — optional

Method

In a bowl combine flour and yeast. Add water and mix until shaggy. Add salt and oil and knead ~8–10 minutes (by hand or in a mixer) until smooth and slightly elastic.

Form a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover. Let rest 1–2 hours at room temp, then refrigerate for 24–72 hours. (Cold slow ferment = more flavor and better texture.)

On bake day, remove from fridge 1–2 hours before shaping to warm up. Divide into two equal balls (~360–380 g each including hydration; they’ll be easier to shape after a 30–60 min bench rest). Let rest 30–60 min, then shape.

Dough — Quick (1 hour)

Ingredients

500 g flour

325 g warm water (~35–40°C)

7 g instant yeast (1 packet)

10 g salt

15 g olive oil

Method

Mix flour and yeast, add warm water and oil, mix until combined. Add salt and knead 6–8 minutes until smooth.

Let rise in a warm place for 30–45 minutes until puffy. Divide, rest 10–15 minutes, then shape and top.

Simple Tomato Sauce (no cook, fast & bright)

Ingredients (enough for 2 pizzas)

1 × 400 g can crushed tomatoes or passata

1 tsp fine salt

1 tsp dried oregano (or 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh basil)

1 tbsp olive oil

pinch sugar (optional)

1 small garlic clove, grated (optional)

Method
Mix everything in a bowl and taste. If using fresh basil, add just before baking/finishing. Keep sauce fairly thin — too much thick sauce makes the crust soggy.

Classic Margherita topping (for 2 pizzas)

250 g fresh mozzarella (drained and torn or thinly sliced)

Fresh basil leaves

Extra virgin olive oil for finishing

1–2 tbsp grated Parmesan (optional)

Assembly: light layer of sauce, distribute cheese sparingly (less is more), bake, then finish with basil and drizzle of olive oil.

Other topping ideas

Pepperoni / Salami + extra mozzarella.

Roasted veg (peppers, zucchini, mushrooms) + goat cheese.

White pizza: garlic + ricotta dollops + sautéed spinach + mozzarella.

BBQ chicken: BBQ sauce base, cooked shredded chicken, red onion, cilantro.

Baking — equipment & temps

Pizza stone or steel (best): place on middle rack, preheat oven to the hottest possible (250–290°C / 480–550°F). Preheat stone/steel 45–60 minutes. Bake 4–7 minutes (watch closely).

Home oven without stone: use an inverted heavy baking sheet preheated for 30–45 min at highest temp. Bake 7–12 minutes.

Cast-iron skillet: preheat skillet very hot, gently transfer stretched dough to skillet, top, bake in oven or finish under broiler for a minute to char top.

Broiler trick: slide pizza onto preheated baking sheet and put under broiler for 2–3 min, watching constantly — fast top browning.

Grill: oil the grill grate and cook over high heat, lid closed — great char.

Bake timing guide

290°C on stone: 4–6 min

250°C on stone/steel: 6–9 min

220–240°C on baking sheet: 9–14 min
Always watch: pizza can go from perfect to burnt quickly.

Quick 10-minute pizza (no dough)

Use pita, naan, pita rounds, tortillas or store bought flatbreads. Spread sauce, add cheese/toppings, bake at 220°C for 6–10 minutes.

Troubleshooting & tips

Crispy bottom, soft interior: preheat stone/steel long enough and use high heat. Thin, evenly stretched dough helps.

Soggy center: don’t overload with sauce/cheese; use drained low-moisture mozzarella; pre-bake crust 2 min before topping for heavy toppings.

Best cheese melt: small shreds of low-moisture mozzarella or tear fresh mozzarella and pat dry on paper towel before using.

Stretch, don’t roll: hand stretch for airy edge (cornicione). Rolling pin compresses bubbles.

Use a peel or parchment: assemble on a floured peel or on parchment for easy transfer. Semolina on peel prevents sticking.

Flavor boost: add a teaspoon of sugar or a splash of balsamic to sauce, or drizzle good olive oil just before serving.

Make-ahead & freezing

Dough: freeze raw dough balls (wrapped) up to 3 months. Thaw in fridge overnight.

Sauce: refrigerates 4–5 days or freezes 2–3 months.

Assembled uncooked pizzas can be frozen on a tray, then wrapped and baked from frozen (add a few minutes).
