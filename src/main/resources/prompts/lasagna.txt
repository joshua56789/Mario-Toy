Time: 1 hr 15-90 min, Oven: 190°C / 375°F
Ingredients:
500 g ground beef (or beef + pork)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
700 ml (24 oz) marinara sauce
9-12 lasagna sheets (no-boil or pre-cooked)
250 g (1 cup) ricotta
1 egg (optional, for ricotta binding)
300-350 g (3-4 cups) shredded mozzarella
50-60 g (½ cup) grated Parmesan
Salt, pepper, 2 tbsp chopped fresh basil or parsley (optional)
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C / 375°F.
Heat oil, sauté onion until soft, add garlic 30 sec, add ground meat and brown; season with salt and pepper.
Stir in marinara, simmer 8-10 min (thicken slightly). If using no-boil sheets, add 60-120 ml water to sauce.
Mix ricotta with egg (if using), half the Parmesan, a pinch salt and herbs.
In a 9×13" (or similar) dish: spread a thin layer of sauce, arrange 3-4 lasagna sheets, spread 1/3 ricotta, sprinkle mozzarella, pour sauce. Repeat 2 more layers. Finish with sauce, remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
Cover with foil (shiny side in) and bake 40 min; uncover and bake 10-15 min until bubbly and golden.
Let rest 10-15 min before slicing. Serve hot.
