Time: 20-30 min active, Chill 4+ hrs, Oven: none
Ingredients:
300 g mascarpone
3 large eggs, separated (or 3 yolks + 150 ml heavy cream)
75-100 g granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla (optional)
200-250 g ladyfingers (savoiardi)
240-300 ml strong cooled espresso or strong coffee
2-3 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional)
Cocoa powder for dusting
Method:
Make coffee; cool and stir in liqueur if using.
Whisk yolks + sugar until pale and thick. Fold in mascarpone (and vanilla).
Whip egg whites to soft-stiff peaks and gently fold into mascarpone mix. (Alternative: fold 150 ml whipped cream instead of whites if you prefer no raw eggs.)
Quickly dip each ladyfinger 1-2 sec per side in coffee (don’t soak) and lay a single layer in a 20×20 cm / 8×8 in (or similar) dish.
Spread half the mascarpone mixture over them. Repeat with a second soaked ladyfinger layer and the remaining mascarpone. Smooth top.
Dust generously with cocoa powder. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve cold.
