Time: 20-30 min
Ingredients:
300 g mascarpone
3 large eggs, separated
75-100 g granulated sugar
200-250 g ladyfingers
240-300 ml strong cooled espresso or strong coffee
Cocoa powder for dusting
Method:
Whisk yolks + sugar until pale and thick. Fold in mascarpone.
Whip egg whites to soft-stiff peaks and gently fold into mascarpone mix.
Quickly dip each ladyfinger 1-2 sec per side in coffee (don't soak) and lay a single layer in a 20Ã—20 cm dish.
Spread half the mascarpone mixture over them. Repeat with a second soaked ladyfinger layer and the remaining mascarpone. Smooth top.
Dust generously with cocoa powder. Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Serve cold.
