Time: 20-30 min
Ingredients:
300 g pizza dough
150 ml tomato sauce
150 g shredded or sliced mozzarella
1 tbsp olive oil

Toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, olives) — keep thinly sliced
Method:
Preheat oven to 250°C.
On a floured surface, stretch/roll dough to ~25-30 cm (10-12") diameter. Transfer to a floured peel or parchment.
Spread sauce thinly, leaving a 2 cm edge. Drizzle olive oil, season with salt/pepper. Add mozzarella and toppings (don't overload).
