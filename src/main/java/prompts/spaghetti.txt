Time: 25–40 min · Stovetop
Ingredients:
200–250 g spaghetti
300–400 g ground beef (or beef+pork)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
400 g canned tomatoes (or passata)
1 tbsp tomato paste (optional, for depth)
Salt, pepper, pinch dried oregano or Italian herbs
30–50 g grated Parmesan, fresh basil or parsley (optional)
Method:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti al dente per package; reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium. Sauté onion until soft, add garlic 30–60s. Add ground meat, break up and brown; season with salt and pepper.
Stir in tomato paste (if using) and canned tomatoes. Simmer 10–15 min to thicken; add herbs and adjust seasoning.
Toss drained spaghetti into the sauce with a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen if needed; heat 1–2 min so sauce clings.
Serve with grated Parmesan and herbs.
