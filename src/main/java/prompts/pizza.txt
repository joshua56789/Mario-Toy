Time: 20–30 min (with store-bought dough) · Oven: 250°C / 475°F
Ingredients:
250–300 g pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)
150 ml tomato sauce (or passata)
150–200 g shredded or sliced mozzarella
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt, pepper
Toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, olives) — keep thinly sliced
Fresh basil or oregano, grated Parmesan (optional)
Method:
Preheat oven to 250°C / 475°F (place a pizza stone or inverted baking tray inside if available).
On a floured surface, stretch/roll dough to ~25–30 cm (10–12") diameter. Transfer to a floured peel or parchment.
Spread sauce thinly, leaving a 1–2 cm edge. Drizzle olive oil, season with salt/pepper. Add mozzarella and toppings (don’t overload).
Slide pizza onto hot stone/tray (or place tray in oven). Bake 8–12 min until crust is blistered and cheese is bubbly (12–15 min on a regular tray).
Remove, top with fresh basil and Parmesan if using. Let rest 1–2 min, slice, serve.
