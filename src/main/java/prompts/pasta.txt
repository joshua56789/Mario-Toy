Time: 15–25 min · Stovetop
Ingredients:
200 g dry pasta (spaghetti, penne, etc.)
1 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, sliced or minced
400 g canned tomatoes (or 400 ml passata) — or 150 ml cream for a creamy version
Salt, pepper, pinch red pepper flakes
30–50 g grated Parmesan
Optional: fresh basil/parsley, cooked chicken/shrimp, olives
Method:
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil, salt well (about 1 tbsp per 4 L). Add pasta and cook to al dente per package; reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain.
While pasta cooks, heat oil in a skillet over medium. Add garlic (and red pepper flakes) and cook 30–60s until fragrant.
Add tomatoes and simmer 5–8 min to thicken; season with salt and pepper. (For a creamy sauce, stir in cream and a knob of butter, warm through.)
Add drained pasta to the sauce with 2–4 tbsp reserved pasta water; toss and cook a minute until sauce clings to the pasta. Add more pasta water if needed.
Stir in Parmesan and herbs, adjust seasoning, and serve hot.
