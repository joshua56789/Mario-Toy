Quick tips & swaps

Always salt pasta water well; it seasons the pasta.

Reserve pasta water — it’s magic for silky sauces.

For vegan versions: use plant-based cream/cheese or skip cheese and add toasted nuts for richness.

To bulk up: add roasted veg, beans, shredded chicken, or sausage.

Make-ahead: tomato sauces & pesto freeze well; carbonara is best fresh.
